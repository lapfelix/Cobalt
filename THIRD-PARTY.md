# Third-party licences

Cobalt is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3. It
links code and embeds fonts written by other people, all under permissive
licences that impose no copyleft of their own, so a binary built from this tree
can be redistributed under the AGPL as long as the notices below travel with
it.

## Rust dependencies

Every crate in the dependency graph, grouped by the licence selected for the
binary distribution. Regenerate the source inventory with:

```
cargo metadata --format-version 1 --all-features
```

| Selected licence | Crates |
| --- | --- |
| Apache-2.0 | dependencies that offer Apache-2.0 as an alternative, including `image`, `http`, `rustls`, `libc`, `png`, `flate2`, `ttf-parser`, and their transitive dependencies |
| MIT | `bytes`, `byteorder-lite`, `memchr`, `minimp3`, `minimp3-sys`, `pulldown-cmark`, `simd-adler32`, `slice-ring-buffer`, `vt100` |
| Apache-2.0 and ISC | `ring` |
| ISC | `rustls-webpki`, `untrusted` |
| BSD-3-Clause | `subtle` |
| CDLA-Permissive-2.0 | `webpki-roots` |
| Zlib | `foldhash` |

Proc-macro and build-script crates (`unicode-ident` and its dependents, `cc`,
and similar) run at compile time only; no code from them ships in a binary, so
their terms do not attach to the distribution.

The release archive contains the complete selected terms and package-specific
notices in `licenses/LICENSE-Rust-dependencies.txt`. That includes `ring`'s
Apache-2.0 and ISC terms and the CDLA-Permissive-2.0 agreement for the Mozilla
CA data bundled by `webpki-roots`.

## Icons

The icon geometry every application draws comes from a published set rather
than being drawn here.

| Set | Licence | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tabler Icons 3.46.0 | MIT | `licenses/LICENSE-Tabler.txt` |

The artwork is converted once, offline, into checked-in Rust at
`crates/kobo-ui/src/vector/tabler.rs`, so nothing at build time or run time
reads an SVG or reaches the network. `scripts/import-icons.sh` reproduces that
file from the upstream tag, and `tools/icon-import/icons.txt` records which
icon stands behind which `Glyph`.

MIT imposes no copyleft, so this geometry travels inside an AGPL binary
without changing anything about it. What it does ask is that the notice
travels too, which is what the file above is for.

## Fonts

Two typefaces are embedded in the `kobo-text` crate and end up inside every
binary. Atkinson Hyperlegible is embedded in two weights, which the one licence
below covers. Their licences ship beside them.

| Font | Licence | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Atkinson Hyperlegible (Regular and Bold) | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | `crates/kobo-text/fonts/LICENSE-AtkinsonHyperlegible.txt` |
| DejaVu Sans | Bitstream Vera and Arev fonts licence | `crates/kobo-text/fonts/LICENSE-DejaVu.txt` |

Both permit embedding and redistribution. The OFL forbids selling the font on
its own and requires the reserved name to be kept, which embedding does not
touch.
