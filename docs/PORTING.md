# Porting Cobalt to another Kobo

Part of [Cobalt](../README.md).

Cobalt selects a device profile at runtime. The Clara BW and Elipsa 2E profiles
are fully hardware-tested at their recorded identity and firmware boundaries.
The current status and exact boundaries are recorded in the
[device support matrix](DEVICES.md#device-support-matrix).

Display and synthetic-touch write entry points demand an exact hardware and
firmware match, so an unknown reader is refused rather than guessed at. A
read-only match is only a porting milestone, not permission to ship or install
the profile. Review every other path that takes device ownership against the
same identity boundary.

This is a genuinely welcome pull request. Open an issue first so the profile
shape can be agreed.

## What is device-specific

Less than you would expect. The SDK, the UI layer, the renderer, the protocol
and every application are device-independent. What is measured is:

1. **A `DeviceProfile`**, in `crates/kobo-profile/src/lib.rs`. Panel size and
   stride, framebuffer identity, the touch device and its axis ranges and
   rotation, and the identity fields (device code, serial prefix, firmware,
   kernel). Its `write_ready` flag remains false until the attended evidence in
   the device support matrix has been reviewed. `CLARA_BW_391` and
   `ELIPSA_2E_389` are the current examples.
2. **`DisplayMetrics`**, in `crates/kobo-ui/src/lib.rs`. Size and DPI, which is
   what the layout engine reasons about.
3. **Runtime profile registration.** `SUPPORTED_PROFILES` in `kobo-profile`
   contains the profiles the runtime may identify. Device tools probe first and
   select a matching hardware profile; panel-write entry points then apply the
   shared `write_ready_profile` gate, which requires exact identity and reviewed
   evidence. The browser/runtime simulator remains Clara BW-sized, so a new
   profile also needs explicit layout coverage for its metrics.

The framebuffer, touch decoder, and refresh planner consume a `DeviceProfile`
rather than assuming one model. A new device can still require narrow discovery
support—for example, recognizing its touch device name—and tests proving that
all write paths use the profile selected from the same probe.

## How to get the numbers

`kobo doctor` is read-only. It opens nothing for writing, grabs no input
device and refreshes no pixel, so it is safe to run against a reader running
its stock software.

It reaches the device over SSH, which a Kobo does not have switched on. Turn
it on first. This step is not gated on the model: it recognises any Kobo
serial, and it only writes files to the USB storage partition, which is the
same partition your books are on.

```sh
cargo run -p kobo-cli -- setup --enable-ssh --no-menu   # over USB, then eject
cargo run -p kobo-cli -- devices                        # find the address
cargo run -p kobo-cli -- doctor --device <address>
```

`--no-menu` leaves the reader's own menus alone, which is what you want here:
Cobalt itself will refuse to run on an unrecognised device, so a launcher
entry for it would only be a button that declines. `--dry-run` shows what
would be written without writing it, and `setup --undo` switches SSH back off
and removes everything it wrote.

The doctor cross-compiles its own ARM binary, copies it over, runs it and
brings the report back. On the Clara BW that report reads:

```
profile: clara-bw-391 (Kobo Clara BW)
device-tree compatible: mediatek,mt8110, mediatek,mt8512
framebuffer: id=hwtcon 1072x1448 virtual=1072x1448 offset=0,0 bpp=32 ...
identity: model=N365 firmware=4.45.23697 kernel=4.9.77 device-code=391
touch: cyttsp5_mt at /dev/input/event1 X=0..1447 Y=0..1071
result: write ready
```

The hardware-verified Elipsa 2E probe is:

```
profile: elipsa-2e-389 (Kobo Elipsa 2E)
framebuffer: id=hwtcon 1404x1872 virtual=1404x1872 offset=0,0 bpp=32 ...
identity: model=N605 firmware=4.38.23697 kernel=4.9.77 device-code=389
touch: Elan Touchscreen at /dev/input/event2 X=0..1872 Y=0..1404
result: write ready
```

Every field a profile needs is on that page. The doctor compares the probe with
the registered profiles. A known device is named; an unknown device is reported
as unsupported after its raw fields are printed, making that report the
starting evidence for a new profile.

The full serial number is deliberately never read past its four-character
model prefix.

## What will refuse to work until the profile is right

By design, all of it. `validate` returns `Rejected` on any mismatch, and every
ordinary write or exclusive-ownership path uses `write_ready_profile`, which
also demands an exact device code, serial prefix, firmware version, kernel
release, and completed attended evidence. A profile that is merely close is
treated as a different device. That is the whole point: geometry alone is not
proof of identity, and the failure mode of guessing is somebody else's reader.

The bounded `kobo smoke-display` operation is the only exception while evidence
is being gathered. The HAL owns its fixed regions, waveform choices,
restoration, and verification and never returns a candidate-capable display
session to the caller. It may ignore only the evidence-pending blocker;
geometry, framebuffer safety, and exact identity remain mandatory. Normal
runtime display, guard, synthetic-tap, and exclusive touch-grab paths stay
blocked until `write_ready` is reviewed and enabled.
