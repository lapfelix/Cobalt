//! Turning something somebody wants to read into something a panel can draw.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! An application on this platform cannot open a file. Everything it reads
//! arrives as bytes (from a download, from the store, from a task) and
//! everything it draws is nodes. This crate is the middle: bytes of some
//! format in, a [`Document`] out, and the Reader turns a `Document` into pages
//! of nodes.
//!
//! # Why a document and not a string
//!
//! Plain text was enough while the only thing being read was Project
//! Gutenberg's plain text, and it is the reason a plain-text reader shows a
//! wall of identical paragraphs. A heading is not a paragraph in bold; it is
//! where a chapter starts, which is what a table of contents is made of, what
//! "next chapter" moves between, and what a reader looks for when they come
//! back to a book after a week. Flattening it to a string throws that away at
//! the first step and no amount of care later gets it back.
//!
//! # The shape of the thing
//!
//! A document is a flat list of [`Block`]s. Not a tree: the panel draws one
//! column of blocks one after another, nothing here nests visually except a
//! quotation, and a tree would be a shape the renderer immediately flattens
//! again. Structure that matters (where a chapter begins) is a block, not a
//! level of nesting.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! Everything here is bounded. These parsers are pointed at bytes from the
//! open internet, on a device with 512 MB of memory shared with the stock
//! reader, and the failure the reader would see is the whole application being
//! killed rather than a message saying the book was odd. So a document has a
//! ceiling on blocks and on total text, and reaching it truncates rather than
//! fails: most of a book is worth more than an error.
