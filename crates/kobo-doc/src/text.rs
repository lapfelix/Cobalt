//! Reading a plain text file as a document.
//!
//! # What "plain text" actually means here
//!
//! Nobody sends a text file with no conventions in it. Project Gutenberg wraps
//! at seventy columns, separates paragraphs with a blank line, centres chapter
//! headings, indents verse, and wraps the whole thing in a licence header and
//! footer. A reader that treats all of that as one undifferentiated stream of
//! sentences produces exactly what a plain-text reader produces: a wall.
//!
//! So this is not "split on blank lines". It recognises the handful of things
//! a text file uses to mean something, and each one is recognised by a rule
//! that would rather miss than guess wrong. A false heading in the middle of
//! a novel is far more jarring than a missed one.
