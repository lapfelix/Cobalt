//! Synthetic taps, for driving a device nobody is standing in front of.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Everything else in this workspace could be checked without hardware and
//! the one thing that mattered could not: whether the screen a reader is
//! looking at responds where it appears to. The simulator answers that for the
//! renderer, because it runs the same one. It cannot answer it for the panel's
//! own touch transform, for a digitiser whose axes are swapped relative to the
//! display, or for a control that is reachable at 1072x1448 in a browser and
//! four millimetres off the glass in a case.
//!
//! # Why it writes to the input device rather than to the application
//!
//! A tap injected into the runtime would be a tap that skipped exactly the
//! machinery worth testing: the digitiser's coordinate space, the profile's
//! `display_to_touch` transform, the multitouch protocol decoder, and the
//! hit-testing that turns a point into an action. So this writes real evdev
//! records to the real touch node, and everything downstream cannot tell the
//! difference -- which is the entire point.
//!
//! The reader that owns touch holds an exclusive `EVIOCGRAB`. That grab
//! excludes other *readers*; the kernel still delivers written events to the
//! grabbing reader, so nothing has to be stopped, unhooked or cooperated with.
//!
//! # What it refuses to do
//!
//! It is behind `device-write` and behind an unlock phrase, because a program
//! that can tap anything can tap the stock reader's factory-reset button.
//! Every point it is given must be on the screen, and it checks all of them
//! before it taps any of them, so a sequence with a bad point in the middle
//! taps nothing rather than stopping halfway through a tour. It holds each
//! contact for a fixed short interval and always lifts: a tap that failed
//! halfway through would leave the digitiser reporting a finger that is not
//! there, and the reader would not respond to a real one until it was
//! rebooted.
//!
//! # Why one invocation can tap more than once
//!
//! It used to tap once and exit, and driving an application meant one
//! invocation per tap. Each of those uploads this binary to the device,
//! verifies its checksum there and removes it again, which on a reader over
//! Wi-Fi costs seconds. A recording is at most five minutes long, so spending
//! several of them on transfers means the tour is mostly the tour not
//! happening.
//!
//! Taking the whole sequence at once costs one upload, and it also puts the
//! clock on the device. Waits between taps are then the waits that were asked
//! for, rather than those waits plus however long an SSH round trip took, so a
//! tap intended to land while a screen is up actually lands while it is up.
