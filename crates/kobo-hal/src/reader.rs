//! Stopping and restarting the stock reader.
//!
//! This is the single most consequential thing the platform does, because
//! nothing on the device restarts the reader for us: `/etc/inittab` respawns
//! only a getty, so a reader that is stopped and not restarted leaves the owner
//! looking at a frozen panel until they power cycle.
//!
//! That is also precisely why it is survivable. The platform never owns boot, so
//! a power cycle always lands in the stock reader. Every failure here costs a
//! reboot and nothing else: no file outside `/tmp` is written, no boot path is
//! touched, and `/tmp` is a tmpfs that a reboot empties.
//!
//! The rules this module enforces:
//!
//! - The reader is identified by the exact executable path in its own
//!   `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, never by a name search, and exactly one match is
//!   required. `pidof`-style matching would happily signal an unrelated process.
//! - Identity is re-verified immediately before the signal is sent, because
//!   process ids are reused and the reader could have exited on its own in
//!   between.
//! - The restart uses the environment, arguments and working directory captured
//!   from the live process, so the reader we start is the reader that was
//!   running rather than a guess about what it needs.
