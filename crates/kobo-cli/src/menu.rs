//! A way into Cobalt from the reader's own menus, by way of NickelMenu.
//!
//! Everything else this CLI does to a reader is undone by renaming a file, and
//! this is the one thing that is not: it hands a tarball to the firmware, and
//! the firmware extracts it as root. So the whole of this module is about
//! being able to say exactly what will be extracted before it is.
//!
//! # Why NickelMenu and not our own
//!
//! The reader's home screen is Qt, drawn by `libnickel.so.1.0.0`, a stripped
//! 24 MB C++ binary. A menu entry means running code inside that process and
//! calling its own methods to build the item, which means: a shared library
//! that Qt will load, resolution of mangled C++ symbols out of a proprietary
//! binary, and rewriting the GOT entry behind one of them under `mprotect`.
//! None of that can be Rust in any useful sense, and all of it is `unsafe`,
//! which this workspace confines to `kobo-abi`. Writing it again would be
//! writing NickelMenu again, without NickelMenu's failsafe.
//!
//! That failsafe is the reason this is safe to do at all. NickelMenu moves its
//! own library aside *before* it hooks anything and only puts it back some
//! seconds after a successful start, so a reader that crashes while hooking
//! comes up at the next boot with nothing to load. It cannot boot-loop.
//!
//! # What this module adds on top
//!
//! The firmware extracts `KoboRoot.tgz` as root without looking inside it. A
//! tarball naming `./etc/init.d/rcS` would be extracted just as willingly as
//! one naming a plugin. So this module refuses to write any archive whose
//! members are not exactly the two paths NickelMenu is supposed to ship, and
//! refuses to overwrite an archive somebody else has already staged.
