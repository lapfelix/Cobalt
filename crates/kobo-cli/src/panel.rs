//! Running one application on the reader's own panel.
//!
//! Everything else in this SDK either builds something or reads something.
//! This starts a session: it stops nothing, but it does take the panel away
//! from whatever is drawing on it, so it is behind `device-write` alongside
//! the other commands that can change what an owner is looking at.
//!
//! There was no subcommand for this at all until now, which meant the one
//! thing a developer does most often, put my app on the screen and look at it,
//! was the one thing they had to hand-write an `ssh` line for. Those lines
//! carried the unlock phrase, a `nohup setsid` incantation and a `timeout`,
//! and getting any of the three wrong left the reader with no panel and no
//! stock interface until it was power cycled.
//!
//! A session is always bounded. `timeout` on the device is what actually ends
//! it, so a session outlives neither the network nor this process: pull the
//! cable, close the laptop, lose Wi-Fi, and the reader still comes back on its
//! own. [`stop`] only exists to end one early.
