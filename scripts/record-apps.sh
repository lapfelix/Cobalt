# This is the moving-picture half of the screenshot loop. A still says what a
# screen looked like once; this says what it did, which is the only way to see
# a tap landing in the wrong place, a screen flashing through a wrong state
# before it settles, or ink left behind by a refresh.
#
# It is a script rather than a list of commands in a README because it is meant
# to be run again. The interesting failures are the ones that appear between
# two runs, and comparing runs is only possible if both were driven the same
# way.

# Read-only on the device. `kobo record` opens the framebuffer for reading and
# never grabs, refreshes or writes it. The taps are real, so the applications
# do move; nothing else on the reader is touched.
